# ProvNet - React-Client

## Setting up the dev environment

1. Run `npm install`.
1. Now you have to link the previously installed and compiled [eth module](https://github.com/vauvenal5/ProvNet/tree/master/eth). This can be done by one of the following ways:
    * Install globally or use the local installation of [linklocal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linklocal) to link the module automatically by simply running the command `linklocal`.
    * Link the [eth module](https://github.com/vauvenal5/ProvNet/tree/master/eth) with help of the `npm link` command as explained in the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link).
1. Run `npm start`. This should now start the react project and open a new browser tab. If the browser is not opened automatically simply navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
